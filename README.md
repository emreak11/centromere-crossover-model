# centromere-crossover-model

This project explores how centromere position might influence crossover probability. I built a simplified stochastic toy model to compare different chromosome configurations (metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric, telocentric). The goal was to translate a genetic intuition into a testable quantitative framework.
